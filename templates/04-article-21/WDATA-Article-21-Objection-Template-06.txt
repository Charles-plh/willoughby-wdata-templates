OBJECTION
I object to processing for direct marketing (including any related profiling). I also object to processing and onward disclosures for marketing/analytics where legitimate interests is relied upon.

Please confirm that direct marketing has ceased and provide any justification for continuing processing (other than direct marketing) if you believe you have compelling legitimate grounds.

Yours faithfully,
