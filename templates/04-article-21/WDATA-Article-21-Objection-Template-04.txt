OBJECTION
I object to processing of my personal data for direct marketing and associated profiling. I also object to processing and onward disclosure to third parties for marketing/analytics purposes where you rely on legitimate interests.

Please confirm what processing you have stopped and what data you have placed on a suppression list (if applicable) to ensure no further marketing occurs.

Yours sincerely,
